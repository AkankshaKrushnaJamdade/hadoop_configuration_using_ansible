# hadoop_configuration_using_ansible

*Here in playbooks folder I have kept the playbook, xml files, jinja templates, vars file. You can provide master IP, directories of respective nodes using vars files. 
The playbook is to configure the hdfs cluster using ansible. It provides a complete automated process to do so and your namenode & datanode will be configured.
You can apply the playbook on the hosts using static inventory or dynamiv inventory.
Using this playbook I have set up Hadoop cluster on aws EC2 instances. For more info and details check out my blog on linkedin :-->
